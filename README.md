# 🏥 Healthcare Provider Directory (Aptos Move Contract)

## 📄 Description

This Move-based smart contract enables a decentralized registry of healthcare providers on the Aptos blockchain. Providers can register themselves by submitting their **name** and **specialization**, and users can retrieve this information using the provider's on-chain address.

This contract demonstrates how core healthcare data can be stored immutably and transparently on a blockchain while giving providers full control over their identity.

## 🌟 Vision

To establish a **trustless, decentralized healthcare identity layer** on Aptos that:

- Allows healthcare professionals to register and verify their credentials.
- Supports public access to accurate provider information.
- Lays the groundwork for interoperable healthcare ecosystems (DApps, insurance, telemedicine, etc.).

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- ✅ **Verification System**: Add third-party or DAO-based credential validation.
- ✅ **Extended Metadata**: Include experience, location, contact info, licenses, etc.
- ✅ **Provider Search Engine**: Enable querying by specialization or region.
- ✅ **Reputation System**: Allow patients to rate providers.
- ✅ **UI Frontend**: Build a simple frontend for easy interaction and registration.
- ✅ **Privacy Support**: Add encrypted or permissioned data access.
